# Modified Public License (MPL) 2.0 with Celebration and Source Code Release Requirements (MPL-CE)

## 1. Definitions
For the purposes of this license, the following definitions apply:
- **"Software"**: The original software, including any modifications, as well as any associated documentation, no including any final product.
- **"Multimedia Celebration"**: Any form of visual, audio, or multimedia display or acknowledgment (such as logos, animations, sounds, credits in a video game, splash screens, and/or promotional materials) that publicly recognizes the Software's authors or contributors.
- **"Modified Software"**: The Software, as modified or adapted in any way by You (the recipient of the license).
- **"Compiled Binaries"**: The version of the Software that is compiled and ready for execution, as well as any associated libraries or dependencies in machine-readable form.

## 2. License Grant
The terms of this license apply to both the original Software and any Modified Software that You distribute. You may:
- Copy, modify, distribute, or sublicense the Software, subject to the conditions below.
- Use the Software in your own software, provided the Software is properly acknowledged as specified in Section 4.

## 3. Multimedia Celebration Requirement
If you distribute the Software or any Modified Software (whether as part of a product, service, or middleware), you are required to provide a **Multimedia Celebration**. This celebration must include at least one of the following, in a manner appropriate for the context in which the Software is used:
- A visual display (such as a splash screen, logo, or title screen) acknowledging the Software.
- An audible acknowledgment (such as a sound or voiceover) during a notable event or at the startup of the application.
- A specific mention of the Software in promotional materials (e.g., ads, game credits, web pages, etc.).

This acknowledgment must be clear, conspicuous, and non-deceptive. It must be easy for the end user to associate the Software with the celebration.

## 4. Modification and Source Code Release
- **Modification of Software**: If you modify the Software and distribute it, you must include the complete source code of the Modified Software, or, at your discretion, a written offer to provide the source code, in accordance with the terms of this license.
- **Shipping with Source Code**: If you distribute Modified Software, you **must ship** the complete source code **with the compiled binaries**. The source code must be available in a manner that is easy to access and not hidden, bundled in the same distribution package as the compiled binaries, or made accessible in the same medium that the compiled binaries are shipped with. This ensures that the source code is always accessible alongside the software.

If the Software is distributed via digital media or online services, the source code must be available through the same medium, embedded within the product itself.

If you distribute the Software as part of a physical product, the source code must either be included on the physical medium or be made available to the recipient via written instructions for obtaining it (e.g., a URL or contact information).

## 5. Special Licensing for Confidential or Secrecy-Based Use Cases
If you are a government, military, research organization, or other entity requiring secrecy for any reason, you may apply for a special licensing exception under this clause. This exception allows you to use the Software or Modified Software without the obligation to disclose or ship the source code, subject to the following conditions:
- You must apply directly to the Licensor (the original copyright holder) or the designated licensing authority for this exception.
- The Licensor may grant or deny such requests based on the intended use case and the confidentiality requirements.
- If granted, the special license will explicitly waive the source code release requirement, and you will not be obligated to provide source code with the compiled binaries or in any other form.
- The use of the Software under this special license must still adhere to the **Multimedia Celebration** requirement, as specified in Section 3.

Please note that this special license is strictly for use cases involving government, military, research, or other sensitive or confidential work, and all such uses must be properly justified and approved.

## 6. Other Requirements
- **Attribution**: You must retain the original copyright notices, disclaimers, and any required credits in the Software or documentation when distributing it.
- **No Trademark Use**: This license does not grant you any rights to use the names, trademarks, or service marks of the original authors, contributors, or other holders of intellectual property rights in the Software.

## 7. No Warranty
The Software is licensed "as-is," without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement.

## 8. Termination
Your rights under this license will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use, modification, and distribution of the Software.
