/*
    In Qwadro, a draw bridge is a context of communications to refer to a network bridge that includes or supports drawing or graphical device functionality. 
    This type of bridge typically integrates with or connects different devices or systems that are involved in graphical or visual processes.

    In Qwadro, a draw bridge is context of transmission of graphical data between draw devices and a draw system.
    This includes managing data streaming, communication protocols, and synchronization.

/*
    In Qwadro, a draw queue is an entity used in graphics programming and rendering to manage and organize the tasks related to drawing or rendering operations. 
    It efficiently handles the sequence and execution of draw commands, particularly in environments where multiple rendering tasks are required.

    A draw queue is a queue of tasks that need to be executed by the graphics system. 
    It organizes these tasks in the order they should be processed.

    The primary purpose of a draw queue is to manage the sequence and execution of drawing operations efficiently. 
    It ensures that rendering commands are executed in a controlled manner, optimizing performance and maintaining consistency in graphical output.

    The commands are processed in the order they are added to the queue. 
    This order is crucial for achieving the desired visual results, especially in complex scenes where the order of rendering affects the final output.

    The draw queue helps in managing synchronization between different rendering tasks, ensuring that operations are performed in the correct sequence and avoiding issues such as race conditions or visual artifacts.

    By batching and organizing draw commands, a draw queue can reduce the overhead associated with frequent state changes or direct hardware interactions.
    It ensures that rendering commands are executed in the correct order, maintaining visual consistency and accuracy.
    And it also helps manage complex scenes and multiple rendering tasks efficiently, which is crucial for high-performance graphics applications.
