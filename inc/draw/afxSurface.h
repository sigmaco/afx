// afxSurface é um objeto que abstrai a ideia de swapchain junto a surface da plataforma.
 
// Swapchains are a list of images, accessible by the operating system for display to the screen.
// You canv create swapchains with more or less images, but generally you will want only 2 or 3 images to perform double-buffer or triple-buffer rendering.

// afxSurface devices operates framebuffers, swapchains, windowSurface and window(?).

/*
    afxSurface is a mechanism that efficiently transfers a sequence of image frames from one API to another.
    A producer and a consumer are attached to two ends of a stream object: a producer adds image frames into the stream,
    and a consumer retrieves image frames from the stream.

    The producer is the entity that posts image frames into the afxSurface. 
    The producer is responsible for inserting each image frame into the afxSurface at the correct time so that the consumer can display the image frame for the appropriate period of time.

    The consumer is the entity that retrieves image frames from the afxSurface. 
    The consumer is responsible for noticing that an image frame is available and displaying it (or otherwise consuming it). 
    The consumer is also responsible for indicating the latency when that is possible (the latency is the time that elapses between the time it is retrieved from the afxSurface until the time it is displayed).

    Draw output refers to the result of a drawing operation in computing or graphics, where data is visually represented on a screen or other display medium. 
    It is the visual representation produced by drawing commands in a graphical application, software, or system.

    In graphics programming, draw output refers to the image or graphical content rendered by a drawing function or command.
    If a program draws a circle, the draw output would be the circle as it appears on the screen.

    In video games and interactive media, draw output is the rendered frames or scenes displayed to the player.
    The graphical representation of game environments, characters, and actions.
    The continuous output of images that create the visual experience in real-time.

    In media streaming, a video endpoint is the device or software that receives and displays video content from a streaming source.
