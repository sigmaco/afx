    The terms near, far, FOV, and frustum are all related to the camera's view and the projection of objects in the 3D world onto the 2D screen.

    NEAR AND FAR PLANES
    Near Plane: This defines how close an object can be to the camera before it is clipped (i.e., not rendered). 
    It's the closest distance from the camera at which objects are visible. Anything closer than this distance will not be rendered.

    Far Plane: This defines how far away an object can be from the camera before it is clipped. 
    It's the farthest distance from the camera at which objects are visible. Anything farther than this distance will not be rendered.

    These two planes together create a "viewing volume" in which the camera can see objects, 
    and this volume is typically defined in a view frustrum (explained below). 
    These planes are usually set based on the needs of your scene, and the closer the near plane, the more details you can capture, 
    but also the greater the risk of depth precision issues.

    FOV (FIELD OF VIEW)
    Field of View (FOV) is the extent of the observable world that is seen at any given moment. 
    It's measured in radians, and it controls how much of the 3D world is visible in the camera’s view.
    Vertical FOV (or Y-axis FOV) defines how much of the scene can be seen vertically.
    The horizontal FOV is derived from the vertical FOV, aspect ratio (screen width/height), and the camera's aspect ratio.

    FOV affects how "zoomed in" or "zoomed out" the scene looks. A wider FOV will show more of the scene, making objects look smaller and farther apart. A narrower FOV will zoom in on objects, making them appear larger and closer.

    A typical FOV for first-person games might be around 90 degrees.
    For a more cinematic look, a lower FOV (e.g., 60 degrees) might be used.
    FOV is set in radians for projection matrix calculations, but values are often specified in degrees in graphics engines.

    FRUSTUM
    The view frustum is a pyramid-like shape that defines the visible area of the 3D world. 
    It's the shape that represents the portion of space the camera can "see".
    The frustum has a near plane at the front, a far plane at the back, the sides (left, right, top, bottom) 
    are determined by the FOV and the aspect ratio of the screen.

    The frustum is what gets transformed by the camera's projection matrix. 
    Any geometry that falls inside the frustum is visible to the camera, while anything outside the frustum is culled and not rendered.
    A typical frustum consists of: near and far planes, the bounds of the frustum in terms of distance; and
    left, right, top, bottom planes, these are defined based on the FOV and aspect ratio of the camera.

    The near and far planes determine how far in front and behind the camera you can see objects.
    The FOV controls how wide or narrow the camera’s view is.
    The frustum is the actual 3D space (a pyramid shape) between the near and far planes that is visible to the camera.
    The projection matrix is used to calculate the transformation of objects in this frustum from 3D space to the 2D screen, 
    taking into account the near and far planes, the FOV, and the aspect ratio. 
    A perspective projection matrix (which is typically used for 3D scenes) will create this frustum, 
    and the projection will “shrink” objects as they get farther from the camera, which is what gives the scene a realistic appearance.
