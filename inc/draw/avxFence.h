// This code is part of SIGMA GL/2 <https://sigmaco.org/gl>

/// Fences are a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a dependency from a queue to the host.
/// Fences have two states - signaled and unsignaled. 
/// A fence can be signaled as part of the execution of a queue submission command. 
/// Fences can be unsignaled on the host with AvxResetFences.
/// Fences can be waited on by the host with the AvxWaitForFences command, and the current state can be queried with AfxGetFenceStatus.

/// The internal data of a fence may include a reference to any resources and pending work associated with signal or unsignal operations performed on that fence object, collectively referred to as the fence’s payload.
/// Mechanisms to import and export that internal data to and from fences are provided below. 
/// These mechanisms indirectly enable applications to share fence state between two or more fences and other synchronization primitives across process and API boundaries.
