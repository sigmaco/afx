/**
    The Qwadro quaternion functions use an 4D vector to represent quaternions, 
    where the X, Y, and Z components are the vector part and the W component is the scalar part.

    afxQuat: A 4-dimensional vector representing a rotation.
    The vector represents a 4 dimensional complex number where multiplication of the basis elements is not commutative(multiplying i with j gives a different result than multiplying j with i).
    Multiplying quaternions reproduces rotation sequences. However quaternions need to be often renormalized, or else they suffer from precision issues.
    It can be used to perform SLERP(spherical - linear interpolation) between two rotations.

/// There is one interesting property of quaternions that comes into play when dealing with interpolation. 
/// If a rotation can be represented by a quaternion q, then the quaterion - q also represents the same rotation. 
/// Why is that ? I'm not going to explain it right now, other than to say that it is connected to the very fabric of reality. 
/// (You think I'm joking but I'm not!) What you need to worry about is which one of these quaternions you are going to use.

/// Esentially this is the same as turning 3 / 4 turn to your right. 
/// One turn is the "short" turn and the other is the "long"one. 
/// When representing a static orientation it is irrelevant if a quaternion represents the short, or long path, because it just sits in the final position and you don't get to see the in-between values. 
/// However, when you are blending it surely does make a difference.

/// When blending between an initial and a final quaternion, there is some ambiguity as to if we are taking the "short" way or the "long" way. 
/// It seems like the right thing to always blend on the shortest path. Given the two input quaternions, it is possible to determine which way we are going to blend. 
/// You can check this by examining the sign of the 4D dot product of the inputs. If the sign is negative, then you know you are going to be blending the long way.

/// So, what do you do if you find out that you are blending the long way? Simply flip the sign on one of your input quaternions.remember q and -q represent the same rotation. 
/// Flipping the sign on one of your inputs will flip the sign of the 4D dot product.

/// Now that we have discussed that little tid-bit, let's move on to interpolation formulas.

/// There are a few different interpolation formulas, but two main ones:
///     NLerp is a linear interpolation of the components that is followed by a normalization of the interpolated quaternion, to ensure that it represents a rotation.
///     Slerp is a spherical interpolation which interpolates in a spherical space, rather than in the cartesian space of the coordinates. 
/// The interpolant of the slerp function moves at a constant motion, while the interpolant of the NLerp has some non-linear acceleration.

/// Heres the quick and dirty: Don't mess around with Slerp, even though you think it might be the more "correct" thing to do. It is too expensive, and has too many special cases that need to be considered. 
/// There are some complicated schemes that try to closely approximate the Slerp function, but it just isn't worth it. Just use NLerp. Especially for computationally strapped code.
