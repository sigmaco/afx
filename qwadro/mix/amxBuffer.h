    The AmxMapBuffers() function maps buffer regions to make them accessible for read/write operations in a graphics or compute system.
    It allows for mapping multiple buffer regions in parallel, managing synchronization, validation, and performing the actual mapping of memory.

    Each buffer mapping is validated, and if it's already mapped, the function ensures the new mapping is within the current mapped region.
    If the buffer has been allocated in host memory (buf->data), the function directly maps the buffer region.
    If the buffer is a MPU-side or managed buffer, the function defers the actual mapping to a later stage using a mix system operation.

    The function uses atomic operations to manage the pending mapping state of each buffer.
    The function waits for any ongoing mapping operations to complete before proceeding.

    The function first checks for a ICD callback function associated with the mix system.
    If the callback is available, it uses it to perform the mapping; otherwise, it falls back to using mix queues and bridges.
    If no callback is available, the function uses a mix queue and mix bridge to handle the buffer remapping.

    The function waits for the mix queue to complete the remapping operation before proceeding.
    After the mapping operations are completed, the function ensures that all buffers have their pendingRemap counters decremented.

    It also performs additional validation (if enabled) to ensure the buffer's mapped state is consistent.
