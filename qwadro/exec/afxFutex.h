/*
    The Qwadro Futex API is a series of functions used for working with a futex-like mechanism that seems to be based on slim locks. 
    The functions provide locking and unlocking functionalities with support for both shared and exclusive locks.

    A futex (short for "fast user-space mutex") is a synchronization mechanism that allows user-space programs to efficiently wait 
    for conditions to change, without involving the kernel unless necessary. When threads are contending for the lock, the futex 
    system call can put them to sleep in the kernel and wake them up when it's appropriate, making it very efficient for certain 
    types of workloads.

    Slim locks enable the threads of a single process to access shared resources;
    they are optimized for speed and occupy very little memory.
    Slim locks cannot be shared across processes.

    Reader threads read data from a shared resource whereas writer threads write data to a shared resource.
    When multiple threads are reading and writing using a shared resource,
    exclusive locks such as a critical section or mutex can become a bottleneck
    if the reader threads run continuously but write operations are rare.
