// The afxMutex class provides access serialization between threads.

// The purpose of a QMutex is to protect an object, data structure or section of code so that only one thread can access it at a time (this is similar to the Java synchronized keyword).
// It is usually best to use a mutex with a QMutexLocker since this makes it easy to ensure that locking and unlocking are performed consistently.

// The QRecursiveMutex class is a mutex, like QMutex, with which it is API-compatible. It differs from QMutex by accepting lock() calls from the same thread any number of times. QMutex would deadlock in this situation.
// QRecursiveMutex is much more expensive to construct and operate on, so use a plain QMutex whenever you can.Sometimes, one public function, however, calls another public function, and they both need to lock the same mutex.In this case, you have two options :
// - Factor the code that needs mutex protection into private functions, which assume that the mutex is held when they are called, and lock a plain QMutex in the public functions before you call the private implementation ones.
// - Or use a recursive mutex, so it doesn't matter that the first public function has already locked the mutex when the second one wishes to do so.
