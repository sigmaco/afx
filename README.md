# SIGMA Acceleration Frameworks Extensions & Experiments
The **Acceleration Frameworks Extensions & Experiments** (**AFX**) is a free and open-source software (FOSS), the standard implementation of the **Qwadro** API specification, ISO C17 open standard, low-level data-oriented, federated execution ecosystem that offers a set of acceleration building blocks to edify system softwares targeting computer simulations and multimedia user experiences. It is essentially a set of software infrastructures whose middlewares, libraries, drivers and engines developed on the Qwadro relies on. AFX is released as open source under the Qwadro License.

The **SIGMA FEDERATION** and all members shall not be held liable to any person or entity for any reason related to the adoption or implementation of, nor adherence to the recommendations in, nor any other use of this project nor any accompanying software.

The codebase was written for compilation in LLVM/Clang. No other toolset was tested except MSVC (and worked when so), which is not officially supported because it has never been a real C compiler. Qwadro also doesn't use CMake because the main developer had problems (and laziness) with Visual Studio 2017, the main IDE used to code the Qwadro since 2017/01/01.

Qwadro was firstly designed for POSIX/Unix/Linux systems. Due to complexities handling multiple OpenGL contexts in Windows, we were forced to move to Windows and stay there still now. Game-related works featured in Qwadro are strongely inspired in notorious engineering works on Bang! Engine by Ensemble Studios and MaxFX by Remedy Entertainment.

There are several strange names in Qwadro, because Qwadro is an experiment that implements several paradigms of the same concept with random names to test both in parallel, and its API changes frequently depending on usage optimization. And... it is governed by methodist laws of Go Horse.
There is some RenderWare semantics heritage still present. For example, we have avxRaster, afxQuat, afxV3d, afxV4d.

> E no Qwadro é assim: o que funciona está bugado, e o que não está bugado não funciona.

## Advanced Video Graphics Extensions & Experiments (AVX)
The **Advanced Video Graphics Extensions & Experiments** (**AVX**) provides the **Qwadro Video Graphics Infrastructure**, which is the foundation for the Draw I/O System that was developed to encapsulates some of the low-level tasks that encompasses functionality for device discovery, solicitation and enumeration, swap-chain creation, and presentation that are needed by device driver interfaces (DDI) and implementations to the Draw I/O System. VGI provides a common framework for future graphics components. It also defines a DDI that manages low-level shared tasks independently from the drawing mechanism runtime. The tasks implemented with VGI will be handled by the VGI DDI.

## Advanced Multimedia Extensions & Experiments (AMX)
The **Advanced Multimedia Extensions & Experiments** (**AMX**) provides the **Qwadro Media Synthesis Infrastructure**, which is the foundation for the Media I/O System that was developed to encompasses functionality for device discovery, solicitation and enumeration, as well as equipments and technologies that support the creation, processing, distribution, and playback of audio content generated by sound synthesis that are needed by device driver interfaces (DDI) and implementations to the Sound I/O System. It also defines a DDI that manages low-level shared tasks independently from the drawing mechanism runtime. The tasks implemented with MSI will be handled by the MSI DDI.

## Advanced MMUX Extensions & Experiments (AUX)
The **Advanced MMUX Extensions & Experiments** (**AUX**) provides the **Qwadro Multimedia UX Infrastructure** (**MMUX**), which is the foundation for the User I/O System that was developed to enhance usability and the user experience in multimedia user interfaces (MMUIs) with shell environments. MMUX manages how windows are opened, closed, resized, and arranged on the screen, contributing to a smooth and organized workflow. It offers options for users to customize themes, layouts, and toolbars to suit their preferences, enhancing personal usability and facilitating user interactions, making complex tasks easier to perform through intuitive designs.

## Advanced 4D Renderization Extensions & Experiments (ARX, AKX, ASX)
The **Advanced 4D Renderization Extensions & Experiments** provides the **Qwadro Renderization Infrastructure** (**QSI**), which is the foundation for the Qwadro Simulation that was developed to encompasses functionality for device enumeration, solicitation and enumeration, and that provide the necessary basic tools and resources for running complex simulations efficiently.
